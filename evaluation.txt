Macbook Pro Retina mid 2012
Mac OS X 10.9 'Mavericks'
2.6 GHz Intel i7
16G memory
with SSD

some problems found, and some persistent without fix:
 - more than 7 clients don't work very well
 - more than 450 downloads/s/client (with 5 clients) too

A pretty stable configuration was:
clients=5
uploadsPerMin=30
downloadsPerMin=450
fileSizeKB=100
overwriteRatio=1.0

The cpu usage is jumping between 30% and 100%.
Memory consumption starts at about 60-70MB and increases to nearly 90Mb after a minute.

Some effort should be put into synchronization optimization since a big proxyInfo lock is not the best thing
possible. Also the subscribing part is implemented very poorly (from a datastructure perspective) because of
a lack of time.
